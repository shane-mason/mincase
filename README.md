# Mini-Server Case STL

A 3D printable case design for a dual-system homelab server combining a Raspberry Pi and mini-PC.

## Overview

This case was designed to house a compact, low-power home server setup for self-hosting cloud service replacements. The design prioritizes aesthetics while accommodating the hardware needed for digital independence.

## Hardware Compatibility

This case is designed to fit:
- **Raspberry Pi** (8GB RAM model with quad-core processor)
- **Mini-PC** (Intel N150 with 12GB RAM)
- **Hard drive enclosure**

## Design

The case was created in TinkerCAD with a focus on clean aesthetics and 24/7 operation in mind. The design accommodates proper airflow for continuous running while keeping the form factor compact.

## Print Recommendations

### Settings
- **Infill**: 15-20% (adequate strength for housing electronics)
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm (good balance of speed and quality)
- **Supports**: May be required depending on your specific design features
- **Material**: PLA or PETG recommended
  - PLA: Easier to print, adequate for most indoor environments
  - PETG: Better heat resistance if your components run warm

### Print Time
Varies by printer and settings, but budget several hours for a case of this size.

## Assembly

1. Print all case components
2. Install the Raspberry Pi in its designated section
3. Mount the mini-PC in its compartment
4. Install the hard drive enclosure
5. Route cables through any provided cable management features
6. Ensure adequate ventilation around all components

## Usage Notes

This case is designed for a server that runs 24/7, so ensure:
- Components have adequate cooling
- Cables are properly routed to avoid blocking airflow
- The case is placed in a location with good ambient airflow
- You have access to ports for initial setup and maintenance


## Project Background

This case was designed as part of a digital independence project focused on moving away from cloud services to self-hosted alternatives. Check out the full project video for details on the software setup and configuration.
